# Face2Emoji
This app takes a photo of the user and recognizes the emotion displayed by the user and accordingly inserts an emoji in the chat's text using the Emotion API and Face API of  Microsoft. It makes the insertion of emoji quite interactive and makes it more natural as the user puts an emoji accordingly as to how they feel at that time.
This makes the task of finding appropriate emoji easier and fun too. This app just shows a minimal viable product of our idea. It can be further implemented in other chat messengers to make it more natural.
